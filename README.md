# DrizzleDungeon
A goblin enters a dungeon. What does he find? Love? Guns? Nothing, because he dies.

A fun game about exploring an infinite dungeon as a goblin who doesn't know how to tie his goblin shoe. You are that goblin, entering that dungeon.
I wish you luck on this adventure, but its probably going to be as bad as DrizzleDum, where the enemies are actually impossible. Good luck!
