# DrizzleDungeon
A goblin enters a dungeon. What does he find? Love? Guns? Nothing, because he dies.

A fun game about exploring an infinite dungeon as a goblin who doesn't know how to tie his goblin shoe. You are that goblin, entering that dungeon.
I wish you luck on this adventure, but its probably going to be as bad as DrizzleDum, where the enemies are actually impossible. Good luck!

Currently: Goblin Creation
-Maybe focus not on weight, height, and age, but a sort of SPECIAL stats. Maybe throw in some color stuff too.

Each floor has a set amount of tiles the goblin can explore, for every tile there will also be a card, "trap, encounter, loot," etc. Game pulls from that card deck each time the goblin steps on a tile.
Floors, days and weeks in dungeon (special events for certain days), armor, weapons, combat
